        <p>Target Eye Monitoring System, which was developed by [[Michael Haephrati]] 12 years ago, was one of the first surveillance and monitoring tools for capturing activity of remote computers. The following description is taken from the original Business Plan of this venture:</p>

<p>**Target Eye Monitoring System  **</p>

<p><em>Target Eye is a start-up company whose mission is to develop integrated software solutions for real-time monitoring of remote PCs, which are based on the companyâ€™s patent pending technologies (60/204,084 and 60/203,832). Our major product, Target Eye Monitoring System, is a software product that can continuously track, record, playback, analyze and report any activity performed on one or multiple remote PCs, in a way which is undetectable by their users. The software relies on a stream of rapidly captured, compressed full-screen images and continuous keystroke capturing to provide a comprehensive and accurate account of user activities, including local activities which do not generate any network traffic. In this way, the software can track and record activities, which are undetectable by systems relying on network traffic analysis. A smart agent module running on the monitored PCs uses a rule base to send alerts to the monitoring location(s) or perform pre-defined local operations. Monitoring can be performed from multiple locations. Major markets are law-enforcement.</em></p>

<p>Target Eye Monitoring System was developed with an auto update mechanism. This mechanism allows smooth and silent (un-attendant) execution of the new version instead of the current one.</p>
